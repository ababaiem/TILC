A Tutorial Introduction to the Lambda Calculus

⒈ Definition

〈 expression 〉∷=〈 name 〉|〈 function 〉|〈 application 〉
〈 function 〉∷= λ〈 name 〉. 〈 expresssion 〉
〈 application 〉∷= 〈 expression 〉〈 expression 〉


In order to simplify expresssions, function application associates from the left.

E₁E₂E₃⋯Eₙ

As such, the above composite expression is evaluated as follows:

(⋯((E₁E₂)E₃)⋯Eₙ)


The identity function is a good example of a function, be it enclosed or not in parentheses:

λx.x ≡ (λx.x)

The equivalence symbol "≡" indicates that when A ≡ B, A is simply as synonym for B.


Functions can be applied to expressions. The following is an example of an application:

(λx.x)y

Parenthesis help us to avoid ambiguity here. They remain, however, optional.

(λx.x)y → y
(λ∇.∇)y → y


The notation [y/x] is used to indicate that all "x" are to be substituted by y in the function's body.

(λx.x)y → [y/x]x → y


The names do not carry meaning themselves, they are simply "place holders".

(λz.z) ≡ (λy.y) ≡ (λt.t) ≡ (λu.u)

This alphabetical substition is called α-reduction.


⒈ ⒈ Free and boud variables

(λx.x)(λy.yx) → λy.yx

(λx.xy)(λy.y)

The variable y is both free and bound in the previous expression.

I ≡ λx.x

II ≡ (λx.x)(λx.x)

To empasize the difference we can rewrite the above expression.

II ≡ (λx.x)(λz.z)

The identity function applied to itself yields itself.

[(λz.z)/x]x → λz.z ≡ I

We should be carefull when performing subtitutions and avoid mixing up free occurences with bound ones.

(λx.(λy.xy))y

An incorrect subtitutions would mix up the two identifiers.

(λy.yy)

We can resolve this by simply renaming the bound y to t.

(λx.(λt.xt))y → (λt.yt)

(λx.(λy.(x(λx.xy))))y → [y/x](λt.(x(λx.xt))) → (λt.(y(λx.xt)))

⒉ Arithmetic

Numbers are represented in λ-calculus starting from zero and writing "successor of zero",

that is "suc(zero)", to represent 1, "suc(suc(zero))" to represent, and so on.

Zero will be defined as following.

λs.(λz.z)

The first natural numbers can be defined using functions.

0 ≡ λs.λz.z

1 ≡ λs.λz.s(z)

2 ≡ λs.λz.s(s(z))

3 ≡ λs.λz.s(s(s(z)))

  ⋮

If we want to apply f to a three times, we apply the function 3 to the arguments f and a.

3fa → (λs.λz.s(s(sz)))fa → f(f(fa))

This way of defining numbers gives us with a language construct similar to "FOR i=1 to 3".

As for the number 0 applied to the arguments f and a yields a unchanged.

0fa = (λs.λz.z)fa → a

The successor function can be defined as follows.

S ≡ λn.λa.λb.a(nab)

For example, the succerssor fuction applied to 0.

S0 ≡ (λn.λa.λb.a(nab))0

S0 → λa.λb.a(0ab) → λa.λb.a(b) ≡ 1

S1 ≡ (λn.λa.λb.a(nab))1 → λa.λb.a(1ab) → λa.λb.a(ab) ≡ 2

Ⅰ Addition

2S3 ≡ (λs.λz.s(sz))S3 → S(S3) → S(4) → 5

This compute 2 + 3.

In general, m + n can be computed with mSn.

Ⅱ Multiplication

(λx.λy.λa.x(ya))

The product of 3 by is 3 is the following.

(λx.λy.λa.x(ya))33 → (λa.3(3a)) → (λa.(λs.λb.s(s(sb)))(3a)) → (λa.λb.(3a)((3a)((3a)b)))

⒊ Conditionals

T ≡ λx.λy.x

F ≡ λx.λy.y

Ⅰ Logical operations

∧ ≡ λx.λy.xyF

∨ ≡ λx.λy.xTy

¬ ≡ λx.xFT

¬T ≡ (λx.xFT)T

TFT ≡ (λc.λd.c)FT → F

Ⅱ A conditional test

Z ≡ λx.xF¬F

0fa ≡ (λs.λz.z)fa ≡ a

Fa ≡ (λx.λy.y)a → λy.y ≡ I

Z0 ≡ (λx.xF¬F)0 → 0F¬F → ¬F → T

ZN ≡ (λx.xF¬F)N → NF¬F

IF → F
